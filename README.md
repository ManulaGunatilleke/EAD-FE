# Web Application's Client Side -  E-commerce Platform


<h2>EAD Assignment</h2>
<p>Complete back-end and front-end implementation of Manage, a website where users can log in as students or instructors. Students can view all courses offered by instructors and enroll in the course themselves and pay through Stripe. Some vulnerabilities in the old project we had built were identified using tools like OWASP ZAP, SonarQub and Postman, and then we fixed them and updated them again. 
<p>The architecture behind Manage is the Microservices architecture which is an architecture that is consisted of small services. All the requests between the client side and the server side is done through the API gateway. Our system has 4 specific microservices,
  <ul>
  <li>User Management System</li>
  <li>Course Management System</li>
  <li>Enrollment Management System</li>
  <li>Payment Management System</li>
</ul>
